 <h1>Manifestation for 7 years later.</h1>
<p style="font-size: 16pt;" "text-align: justify;">
 	I put the highest hope on the future me. 7 years are enough for me to change and develope. I want to be someone who's already make peace with myself, thus I can continue my life without any past burden. I also want to be financially stable so I can make my mom retire and enjoy her life to the fullest. Not only that, in 7 years I can skate better and without worrying I can't afford the next month skating lesson. I can compete anytime I want. Bangchan si kucing jelek also will have a better life and food. I will pay my little sister and brother's college tuition and give them enough pocket money so they don't have to struggle like I did when I was still in college 7 years ago. </p>

 	<h1>Fake it till you make it.</h1>
 	<p style="font-size: 16pt;" "text-align: justify;">
 		To achieve all the things I've been manifesting, I have to win the battle against myself. Those intrusive thoughts, all ups and down, the voices inside my head that telling me to give up. Getting my bachelor degree as my stepping stone, and then working on my ability so that I can get promoted to a higher position. After I have enough savings, I will start my own business. It helps me to have more income. Do you know why I choose "fake it till you make it" as the title of this part? I think that phrase is another way to say <b>dream affirmation</b> or <b>dream manifestation.</b>
